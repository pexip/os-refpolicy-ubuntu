  [ Caleb Case ]
  * New upstream SVN HEAD.
   - Labeled networking peer object class updates.
   - Patch for debian logrotate to handle syslogd-listfiles, from Vaclav Ovsik.
   - Improve several tunables descriptions from Dan Walsh.
   - Patch to clean up ns switch usage in the policy from Dan Walsh.
   - More complete labeled networking infrastructure from KaiGai Kohei.
   - Add interface for libselinux constructor, for libselinux-linked
     SELinux-enabled programs.
   - Patch to restructure user role templates to create restricted user roles
     from Dan Walsh.
   - Russian man page translations from Andrey Markelov.
   - Remove unused types from dbus.
   - Add infrastructure for managing all user web content.
   - Deprecate some old file and dir permission set macros in favor of the
     newer, more consistently-named macros.
   - Patch to clean up unescaped periods in several file context entries from
     Jan-Frode Myklebust.
   - Merge shlib_t into lib_t.
   - Merge strict and targeted policies.  The policy will now behave like the
     strict policy if the unconfined module is not present.  If it is, it will
     behave like the targeted policy.  Added an unconfined role to have a mix
     of confined and unconfined users.
   - Added modules:
   	exim (Dan Walsh)
   	postfixpolicyd (Jan-Frode Myklebust)
   - Add support for setting the unknown permissions handling.
   - Fix XML building for external reference builds and headers builds.
   - Patch to add missing requirements in userdomain interfaces from Shintaro
     Fujiwara.
   - Add tcpd_wrapped_domain() for services that use tcp wrappers.
   - Update MLS constraints from LSPP evaluated policy.
   - Allow initrc_t file descriptors to be inherited regardless of MLS level.
     Accordingly drop MLS permissions from daemons that inherit from any level.
   - Files and radvd updates from Stefan Schulze Frielinghaus.
   - Deprecate mls_file_write_down() and mls_file_read_up(), replaced with
     mls_write_all_levels() and mls_read_all_levels(), for consistency.
   - Add make kernel and init ranged interfaces pass the range transition MLS
     constraints.  Also remove calls to mls_rangetrans_target() in modules that 
     use the kernel and init interfaces, since its redundant.
   - Add interfaces for all MLS attributes except X object classes.
   - Require all sensitivities and categories for MLS and MCS policies, not just
     the low and high sensitivity and category.
   - Database userspace object manager classes from KaiGai Kohei.
   - Add third-party interface for Apache CGI.
   - Add getserv and shmemserv nscd permissions.

   	application
   	awstats (Stefan Schulze Frielinghaus)
   	bitlbee (Devin Carraway)
   	brctl (Dan Walsh)
   - Fix incorrectly named files_lib_filetrans_shared_lib() interface in the
     libraries module.
   - Unified labeled networking policy from Paul Moore.
   - Use netmsg initial SID for MLS-only Netlabel packets, from Paul Moore.
   - Xen updates from Dan Walsh.
   - Filesystem updates from Dan Walsh.
   - Large samba update from Dan Walsh.

     permissions from Dan Walsh.
   - Patch to dontaudit logrotate searching avahi pid directory from Dan Walsh.
   - Patch to allow insmod to mount kvmfs and dontaudit rw unconfined_t pipes
     to handle usage from userhelper from Dan Walsh.
   - Patch to allow amavis to read spamassassin libraries from Dan Walsh.
   - Patch to allow slocate to getattr other filesystems and directories on those
     filesystems from Dan Walsh.

     template instead of an interface.
   - Added modules:

  * Allow users to read the dpkg database. With this change, every user
    of the strict policy now has access to dpkg-checkbuildeps, grep-dctrl,
    etc, which was not the case previously.
  * Change the example localStrict.te policy file to silently ignore apt
    searching for something in /var/lib. With this example policy loaded
    in my strict policy UML virtual machine, I can compile packages in
    enforcing mode. Based on advice on the mailing list, allow more things

    - Added an interface to apt.if allow silently ignoring processes that

    - Added some stuff to dpkg.te to allow debconf .config file
      interactions back to the user 
    - Add an optional  dontaudit rule to libraries.te to allow
      apt-get/aptitude to install packages silently. 
  * Very early in boot, /lib/init/rw is created as a mandatory tmpfs for
    state information. Label that directory as initrc_tmp_t to allow

  * Add policy for log and lock files for aptitude. This is needed for
    proper function; so one does not need to go into permissive mode to
    run aptitude.  Stolen from Erich. This is a low risk change.
  * Debian puts grub in /usr/sbin/grub. Reflect that in the initial file
    context. 
  * Debian creates /dev/xconsole independently of whether or not a xserver
    has been installed or not. So move the policy related to /dev/sconsole
    out of the xserver policy, and into places where relevant (init.te,
    logging.fc), to reflect the status that /dev/console is present
    anyway.
  * Add support for /etc/network/run  and /dev/shm/network, which seem to
    be Debian specific as well.
  * Allow udev to manage configuration files.

  * Bug fix: "selinux-policy-refpolicy-targeted: does not suggest a way to
    fix the 'maybe failing' attempt in postinst", thanks to Eddy Petrisor.
    While this does not belong in the postinst, I have addedthis to the 
    README.Debian file. This should be a low risk change. (Closes: #407691).
  * Bug fix: "Default build.conf doesn't match default strict/targeted
    policy", thanks to Stefan.The build.conf included in the reference
    source policy describe to build a policy of the type "strict". The
    default binary policies coming with Debian are build with the policy
    type "strict-mcs" or "targeted-mcs". Change the build.conf shipped in
    source to conform to what we really use. (changes TYPE=strict to 
    TYPE=strict-mcs, very low risk change.                (Closes: #411256).
  * Bug fix: "selinux-policy-refpolicy-targeted: openvpn policy do not
    allow tcp connection mode", thanks to Rafal Kupka. This bug really
    should be at least important, and we should fully support a class of
    security product like OpenVPN on machines which are running SELinux,
    and this is a very low risk change.                    (Closes: #409041).
  * Install header files required for policy building for both strict and
    targeted policies in a new -dev package, so it becomes really useful
    to work with the source package. Moved the examples from the -src
    package to this new -dev package, since the example is only useful in
    with the headers provided. This is a new package, but it contains only
    files already in the sources (No upstream changes at all), and is the
    result of make install-headers. This new package has no rdepends, and
    should be a very low risk addition to Debian.
  * This release should be a whole lot better for building local policies,
    including the policygentool for creating a new policy from scratch,
    and ability to build local policy modular packages. The build.conf
    files have been cleaned up, and the source policy defaults to targeted
    policy, which is standard in Debian, as opposed to the strict policy,
    which has priority optional.

  * Bug fix: "refpolicy: FTBFS: /bin/sh: debian/stamp/config-strict: No
    such file or directory", thanks to Lucas Nussbaum. This was fixed by
    moving all the stamps into ./debian instead. I'll re-visit the
    ./debian/stamp/ directory in lenny. This is a pretty minor packaging
    change.                                                 (Closes: #405613).
  * Bug fix: "selinux-policy-refpolicy-targeted: Policy for dcc misses
    Debian's FHS paths", thanks to Devin Carraway. From the bug report:
    Many of the files in these packages are overlooked when labelling
    files, because refpolicy's dcc module stipulates paths not consistent
    with the Debian FHS layout.  The files go unlabelled and dcc-client
    (at least) stops working. The two major problems  are the references
    to /usr/libexec/dcc (damons, placed in /usr/sbin by the Debian
    packages) and to /var/dcc (all sorts of things, placed under
    /var/lib/dcc).  A side effect of the latter is that dccifd_t and
    probably others need search on var_lib_t, through which it must pass
    to get to /var/lib/dcc.  Fixed the policy; will send upstream.
                                                             (Closes: #404309).
  * Bug fix: "selinux-policy-refpolicy-targeted: clamav policy forbids
    clamd_t search on /var/lib", thanks to Devin Carraway.  This is a
    simple one line change, and obviously an oversight; I think getting
    clamd to work is fairly important.                        (Closes: #404895).
  * Bug fix: "selinux-policy-refpolicy-targeted: Multiple problems with
    courier policy", thanks to Devin Carraway.  There is detailed
    information of the changes made in the bug report, and in the commit
    logs. Again, fixing courier daemons seems pretty important; SELinux
    tends to get used a lot on remote mail servers, and this fixes issues
    with the policy.                                          (Closes: #405103).

  * The This update enables MCS for targeted and strict, uses 1024
    categories (as Fedora uses - necessary for compatability). Please note
    that enabling MCS categories is required for compatibility with
    filesystems created on Fedora Core 5 and above, RHEL 5 and above, and
    CentOS 5 and above.  MCS categories is also a feature that we plan for
    all future releases of SE Linux and does not have a nice upgrade path

  * Bug fix: "selinux-policy-refpolicy-src: Compile failure of modular
    targeted policy", thanks to Simon Richard Grint. Put a wrapper around
    the offending lines to only take effect when running a strict policy.
                                                            (Closes: #384502).
  * Bug fix: "make: /usr/sbin/setfiles: Command not found", thanks to Uwe
    Hermann. Fixed upstream.                                (Closes: #384850).

  * Bug fix: "Needs gawk", thanks to Simon Richard Grint
                                                         (Closes: #382821).
  * Bug fix: "Move /etc/selinux/refpolicy/src/policy/man/man8/*
    manpages?", thanks to Uwe Hermann                    (Closes: #372789).
  * Fix errors in post installation initial policy creation process in the
    postinst. 
  * Add directories required during policy build during postinst. This bug
    prevented any policies being built when the package was initially
    installed. Also, create an empty  file_contexts.local file if it does
    not already exist. 
  * Make selinux-policy-refpolicy-targeted provide and replace the
    obsolete package selinux-policy-default; which should in the future be
    just a virtual package. 
  * Added postrm packages to strict and targeted policy packages, in order
    to clean out the directories in which files are created during policy
    build. 
  * Rewrote the postinst in perl to allow us to do module dependency
    checks, and to map policy modules to debian packages, in order to
    better detect the modules that would be necessary for the target
    machine. 
  * Also, compiling with either MCS or MLS produced errors while
    installing policy, since we lack setrans daemon. So we are now
    building with out them, created an easy to modify option to re-enable
    it later.
  * Updated modules.conf to use the latest offerings from Erich.

  * New upstream checkout from CVS.
  * Until module linking is fixed, build everything into base.
    (Sorry, this will result in a much larger policy than necessary.
     Feel free to use the -src package to build your own!)

  * Make modular policy actually work. Hopefully.
    (Up to now, optional_policy(`module') in base was not working upstream!)
  * Revamp build process, don't use CDBS anymore since I didn't figure out
    how to do two clean runs of the same source tree, and there is little
    benefit here without any autotools or library magic needed

  * New upstream CVS checkout.
  * Move policy src from /etc to /usr/share/selinux/refpolicy
    This avoids an apt-get size limitation and follows Fedora.
  * Ship edited build.conf with policy source.
  * Use debhelper for installing documentation.
  * Add dependency for source onto gawk.

  * New upstream CVS checkout.
  * Thomas also provided a workaround for the make issues in his version.
  * Update dpkg/apt policy to interface renamings
  * Remove dpkg_script_exec_t, as supporting this would require bad hacks
    to dpkg and/or tar. Use dpkg_var_lib_t instead.
